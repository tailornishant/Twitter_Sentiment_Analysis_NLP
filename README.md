# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_NLP

#### <span style = 'color:blue'> Problem statement : Perform sentiment analysis on Omnicron variant, data fetching directly from twitter</span>
**Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying feelings and emotions expressed in words, through ML or AI**

**Project Pipeline**

Various steps in completing project are

- **Import Necessary Dependencies**
- **Read and Load the Dataset**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- **Data Visualization of Target Variables**
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Splitting our data into Train and Test Subset**
- **Transforming Dataset using TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- **Function for Model Evaluation**
- **Model Building**
- **Conclusion**

- Here we have to get dataset directly fetched from twitter in realtime 

- performing realtime sentimental analysis on realtime data collecting from twitter
- objective: perform sentiment analysis on realtime data collected from twitter 

                      

  ### *Some tips to consider*

- Machines can learn in every possible way so its always better to think out of the box
    
- Perform eda as diverse as possible and in contineous manner
    
- Try configuring with diffrent models to know how each model is diffrent with other ones 
    
- Donot try to involve unneccesory codes and useless algorithms for dataset which just increases complexity
    
- Approaching problem statement in n number of ways helps us to find best one possible
    
- It's easier for one to understnd and manupulate if we have models as simple as possible 
    
- When we have multiple models we can have multiple judgements based on models and their efficiencies
    
- Tuning helps increasing accuracy :)
    
- Have an idea of time consumed by the model, its better to have a model whose time management is good
    
- Spend good amount of time on analyzing dataset and draw as much insights as possible
